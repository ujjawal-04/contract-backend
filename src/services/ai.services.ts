        ${contractText}

        REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS:
        ${modifications.map((mod, index) => `${index + 1}. ${mod}`).join('\n')}

        CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS FOR PDF GENERATION:
        1. DO NOT start the contract with blank lines or excessive spacing
        2. Begin immediately with the contract title
        3. Use consistent single line spacing between paragraphs
        4. Use double line spacing between major sections
        5. Structure with proper professional formatting suitable for legal documents
        6. Use clear section headers with numbering (e.g., "1. PARTIES", "2. TERMS AND CONDITIONS")
        7. Include appropriate sub-sections with proper numbering (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
        8. Maintain consistent paragraph spacing and indentation
        9. Use formal legal language and terminology
        10. Include proper clause structures with clear definitions
        11. Ensure all modifications are seamlessly integrated into the existing structure
        12. Mark modified sections with [MODIFIED] tags around changed content only
        13. NO BLANK PAGES - start content immediately

        SPECIFIC SPACING RULES:
        - Single line break between sentences within paragraphs
        - Double line break between paragraphs
        - Double line break between sections
        - NO triple or quadruple line breaks anywhere
        - Contract should start immediately with title, no leading spaces/lines

        Return the complete modified contract with professional formatting, proper structure, and clear [MODIFIED] tags around only the changed portions. The output should be ready for professional PDF generation with NO blank pages and consistent line spacing.`;
